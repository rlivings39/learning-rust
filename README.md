# Learning Rust

Going through the tutorial

https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html

## Managing things with `rustup`

`rustup` is a CLI tool for managing Rust versions.

`rustup update` will update Rust

`rustup doc` opens the local doc

## Cargo - the build system and package manager

`cargo new hello_world` is a good way to create a new Rust project. If the folder exists use `cargo init`.

`Cargo.toml` defines your project, dependencies, etc.

`cargo build` builds your project

`cargo build --release` builds in release mode

`cargo run` runs your project

`cargo check` checks code but doesn't build it
